# Female Leadership ARP

PROJECT SPECIFICATION

Succinct background

Gender stereotypes explain the underrepresentation of female leaders. For example, gender stereotypes regarding emotions play a central role because they serve as an overarching organizing principle for other beliefs. There is substantial evidence the long-standing lay belief that ‘emotion detracts from rational thought’ justifies the related belief that female ‘leaders cannot effectively respond to and learn from critical feedback and failures.’

Problem formulation

Policy makers have introduced effective measures to promote female leadership. For example, the government of Norway required publicly listed firms in the country to have at least 40% women top management teams. As a result, Norwegian firms have grown more than counterpart Scandinavian firms.1 But how about those countries in which gender quota policies have not been adopted? Has the female leadership gap shrunk over the last decades? Then, to what extent?

Specific Aims

The project’s goal is twofold:

• First, helping DLRC define a new, data-science oriented approach to explain/predict the change in gender composition of publicly listed companies’ top management teams;
• Second, to mobilize the just mentioned approach to:
  o assess the likelihood a top management team vacancy is filled with a
female manager;
  o assess how and to what extent the just the estimated likelihood has
changed over the last decades and across countries/cultures; o estimate the consequences of top management team gender
composition on companies’ economic and financial performance
